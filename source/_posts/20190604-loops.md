## Objective

In this challenge, we practice looping over the characters of string. Check out the attached tutorial for more details.

## Task

Complete the vowelsAndConsonants function in the editor below. It has one parameter, a string, **s**, consisting of lowercase English alphabetic letters (i.e., a through z). The function must do the following:

1. First, print each vowel in **s** on a new line. The English vowels are a, e, i, o, and u, and each vowel must be printed in the same order as it appeared in **s**.
2. Second, print each consonant (i.e., non-vowel) in **s** on a new line in the same order as it appeared in **s**.

## Input Format

Locked stub code in the editor reads string **s** from stdin and passes it to the function.

## Output Format

First, print each vowel in **s** on a new line (in the same order as they appeared in **s**). Second, print each consonant (i.e., non-vowel) in **s** on a new line (in the same order as they appeared in **s**).

s
```

## Explanation 0

Observe the following:

- Each letter is printed on a new line.
- Then the vowels are printed in the same order as they appeared in **s**.
- Then the consonants are printed in the same order as they appeared in **s**.

## Solution

```javascript
/*
 * Complete the vowelsAndConsonants function.
 * Print your output using 'console.log()'.
 */
const vowel = ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'];

function vowelsAndConsonants(s) {
  let { vowels, consonants } = (s.split('') || []).reduce(
    (target, item) => {
      target[vowel.includes(item) ? 'vowels' : 'consonants'].push(item);

      return target;
    },
    { vowels: [], consonants: [] }
  );

  vowels.concat(consonants).forEach(item => {
    console.log(item);
  });
}
```
