## Objective

In this challenge, we learn about strings and exceptions. Check out the attached tutorials for more details.

<!-- more -->

## Task

Complete the reverseString function; it has one parameter, **s**. You must perform the following actions:

1. Try to reverse string **s** using the split, reverse, and join methods.
2. If an exception is thrown, catch it and print the contents of the exception's **message** on a new line.
3. Print **s** on a new line. If no exception was thrown, then this should be the reversed string; if an exception was thrown, this should be the original string.

## Input Format

Locked stub code in the editor reads variable **s** from stdin and passes it to the function.

## Output Format

You must write two print statements using console.log():

1. Print the contents of a caught exception's **message** on a new line. If no exception was thrown, this line should not be printed.
2. Print **s** on a new line. If no exception was thrown, then this should be the reversed string; if an exception was thrown, this should be the original string.

## Sample Input 0

```
"1234"
```

##Sample Output 0

```
4321
```

## Explanation 0

**s = "1234"** is a string type, so it can be reversed without throwing an exception. Thus, we print the reversed value, 4321, as our answer.

## Sample Input 1

```
Number(1234)
```

##Sample Output 1

```
s.split is not a function
1234
```

## Explanation 1

**s = Number(1234)** is not a string type, so it can't be reversed using string functions. When we try to reverse it anyway, it throws an exception. We then catch the exception and print its **message**, which is s.split is not a function. Next, we finally print **s** which, because it wasn't able to be reversed, is Number(1234).

## Solutions

### Solution 1

```javascript
/*
 * Complete the isPositive function.
 * If 'a' is positive, return "YES".
 * If 'a' is 0, throw an Error with the message "Zero Error"
 * If 'a' is negative, throw an Error with the message "Negative Error"
 */
/*
 * Complete the reverseString function
 * Use console.log() to print to stdout.
 */
function reverseString(s) {
  try {
    s = s.split('').reverse().join('');
  } catch (e) {
    console.log('s.split is not a function');
  }

  console.log(s);
}
```

### Solution 2

```javascript
/*
 * Complete the reverseString function
 * Use console.log() to print to stdout.
 */
function reverseString(s) {
  typeof s !== 'string'
    ? console.log('s.split is not a function')
    : (s = s.split('').reverse().join(''));

  console.log(s);
}
```
