A modified Kaprekar number is a positive whole number with a special property. If you square it, then split the number into two integers and sum those integers, you have the same value you started with.

Consider a positive whole number **n** with **d** digits. We square **n** to arrive at a number that is either **2 x d** digits long or **(2 x d) - 1** digits long. Split the string representation of the square into two parts, **l** and **r**. The right hand part, **r** must be **d** digits long. The left is the remaining substring. Convert those two substrings back to integers, add them and see if you get **n**.

For example, if **n = 5**, **d = 1** then **n<sup>2</sup> = 25**. We split that into two strings and convert them back to integers **2** and **5**. We test ![](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?2&space;+&space;5&space;=&space;7&space;\neq&space;5), so this is not a modified Kaprekar number. If **n = 9**, still **d = 1**, and **n<sup>2</sup> = 81**. This gives us **1 + 8 = 9**, the original **n**.

**Note**: r may have leading zeros.

Here's an explanation from Wikipedia about the **ORIGINAL** [Kaprekar Number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaprekar_number) (spot the difference!):

> In mathematics, a Kaprekar number for a given base is a non-negative integer, the representation of whose square in that base can be split into two parts that add up to the original number again. For instance, 45 is a Kaprekar number, because 45Â² = 2025 and 20+25 = 45.

Given two positive integers **p** and **q** where **p** is lower than **q**, write a program to print the modified Kaprekar numbers in the range between **p** and **q**, inclusive.

## Function Description

Complete the kaprekarNumbers function in the editor below. It should print the list of modified Kaprekar numbers in ascending order.

kaprekarNumbers has the following parameter(s):

- p: an integer
- q: an integer

## Input Format

The first line contains the lower integer limit **p**.
The second line contains the upper integer limit **q**.

**Note**: Your range should be inclusive of the limits.

## Constraints

0 < p < q < 100000

## Output Format

Output each modified Kaprekar number in the given range, space-separated on a single line. If no modified Kaprekar numbers exist in the given range, print `INVALID RANGE`.

## Sample Input

```
1
100
```

## Sample Output

```
1 9 45 55 99
```

## Explanation

**1**, **9**, **45**, **55**, and **99** are the Kaprekar Numbers in the given range.

### Solution

```javascript
// Complete the kaprekarNumbers function below.
function kaprekarNumbers(p, q) {
  let result = Array.from(
    { length: q - p + 1 },
    (value, index) => index + p
  ).reduce((target, value, index) => {
    let square = `${value ** 2}`;
    let right = +square.substring(
      square.length - `${value}`.length,
      square.length
    );
    let left = +square.substring(0, square.length - `${value}`.length);

    left + right == value && target.push(value);

    return target;
  }, []);

  console.log(!result.length ? "INVALID RANGE" : result.join(" "));
}
```
