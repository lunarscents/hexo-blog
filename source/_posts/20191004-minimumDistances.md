We define the distance between two array values as the number of indices between the two values. Given **a**, find the minimum distance between any pair of equal elements in the array. If no such value exists, print **-1**.

For example, if **a = [3,2,1,2,3]**, there are two matching pairs of values: **3 and 2**. The indices of the **3**'s are **i = 0** and **j = 4**, so their distance is **d[i,j] = |j - i| = 4**. The indices of the **2**'s are **i = 1** and **j = 3**, so their distance is **d|i,j| = |j - i| = 2**.

## Function Description

Complete the minimumDistances function in the editor below. It should return the minimum distance between any two matching elements.

minimumDistances has the following parameter(s):

- a: an array of integers

## Input Format

The first line contains an integer **n**, the size of array **a**.<br/>
The second line contains **n** space-separated integers **a[i]**.

## Constraints

- 1 <= n <= 10<sup>3</sup>
- 0 <= a[i] <= 10<sup>5</sup>

## Output Format

Print a single integer denoting the minimum **d[i,j]** in **a**. If no such value exists, print **-1**.

## Sample Input

```
6
7 1 3 4 1 7
```

## Sample Output

```
3
```

## Explanation

Here, we have two options:<br/>

- **a[1]** and **a[4]** and are both **1**, so **d[1,4] = |1 - 4| = 3**.
- **a[0]** and **a[5]** and are both **7**, so **d[0,5] = |0 - 5| = 5**.

The answer is **min(3,5) = 3**.

### Solution

```javascript
// Complete the minimumDistances function below.
function minimumDistances(a) {
  let result = 0;

  for (let i of Array.from({ length: a.length }, (value, index) => index)) {
    for (let j of Array.from(
      { length: a.length },
      (value, index) => index + i + 1
    )) {
      ((a[i] === a[j] && !result) ||
        (a[i] === a[j] && Math.abs(i - j) < result)) &&
        (result = Math.abs(i - j));
    }
  }

  return !result ? -1 : result;
}
```
