Given the time in numerals we may convert it into words, as shown below:

**<p align="center">5:00 -> five o'clock</p>**
**<p align="center">5:01 -> one minute past five</p>**
**<p align="center">5:10 -> ten minutes past five</p>**
**<p align="center">5:15 -> quarter past five</p>**
**<p align="center">5:30 -> half past five</p>**
**<p align="center">5:40 -> twenty minutes to six</p>**
**<p align="center">5:45 -> quarter to six</p>**
**<p align="center">5:47 -> thirteen minutes to six</p>**
**<p align="center">5:28 -> twenty eight minutes past</p>**

<br/>

At **minutes = 0**, use o' clock. For **1 <= minutes <= 30**, use `past`, and for **30 < minutes** use `to`. Note the space between the apostrophe and clock in `o' clock`. Write a program which prints the time in words for the input given in the format described.
