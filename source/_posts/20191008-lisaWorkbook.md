Lisa just got a new math workbook. A workbook contains exercise problems, grouped into chapters. Lisa believes a problem to be special if its index (within a chapter) is the same as the page number where it's located. The format of Lisa's book is as follows:

- There are **n** chapters in Lisa's workbook, numbered from **1** to **n**.
- The **i<sup>th</sup>** chapter has **arr[i]** problems, numbered from **1** to **arr[i]**.
- Each page can hold up to **k** problems. Only a chapter's last page of exercises may contain fewer than **k** problems.
- Each new chapter starts on a new page, so a page will never contain problems from more than one chapter.
- The page number indexing starts at **1**.

Given the details for Lisa's workbook, can you count its number of special problems?

For example, Lisa's workbook contains **arr[1] = 4** problems for chapter **1**, and **arr[2] = 2** problems for chapter **2**. Each page can hold **k = 3** problems. The first page will hold **3** problems for chapter **1**. Problem **1** is on page **1**, so it is special. Page **2** contains only Chapter **1**, Problem **4**, so no special problem is on page **2**. Chapter **2** problems start on page **3** and there are **2** problems. Since there is no problem **3** on page **3**, there is no special problem on that page either. There is **1** special problem in her workbook.

**Note**: See the diagram in the Explanation section for more details.

## Function Description

Complete the workbook function in the editor below. It should return an integer that represents the number of special problems in the workbook.

workbook has the following parameter(s):

- n: an integer that denotes the number of chapters
- k: an integer that denotes the maximum number of problems per page
- arr: an array of integers that denote the number of problems in each chapter

## Input Format

The first line contains two integers **n** and **k**, the number of chapters and the maximum number of problems per page.<br/>
The second line contains **n** space-separated integers **arr[i]** where **arr[i]** denotes the number of problems in the **i<sup>th</sup>** chapter.

## Constraints

- 1 <= n,k,arr[i] <= 100

## Output Format

Print the number of special problems in Lisa's workbook.

## Sample Input

```
5 3
4 2 6 1 10
```

## Sample Output

```
4
```

## Explanation

The diagram below depicts Lisa's workbook with **n = 5** chapters and a maximum of **k = 3** problems per page. Special problems are outlined in red, and page numbers are in yellow squares.

There are **4** special problems and thus we print the number **4** on a new line.

### Solution

```javascript
// Complete the workbook function below.
function workbook(n, k, arr) {
  let result = 0;
  let page = 1;

  for (let i of Array.from({ length: n }, (value, index) => index)) {
    const problems = arr[i];

    for (let j of Array.from(
      { length: problems },
      (value, index) => index + 1
    )) {
      j === page && result++;

      j !== problems && !(j % k) && page++;
    }

    page++;
  }

  return result;
}
```
