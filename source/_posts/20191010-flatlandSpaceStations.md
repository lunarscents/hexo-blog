Flatland is a country with a number of cities, some of which have space stations. Cities are numbered consecutively and each has a road of **1km** length connecting it to the next city. It is not a circular route, so the first city doesn't connect with the last city. Determine the maximum distance from any city to it's nearest space station.

For example, there are **n = 3** cities and **m = 1** of them has a space station, city **1**. They occur consecutively along a route. City **2** is **2 - 1 = 1** unit away and city **3** is **3 - 1 = 2** units away. City **1** is **0** units from its nearest space station as one is located there. The maximum distance is **2**.

## Function Description

Complete the flatlandSpaceStations function in the editor below. It should return an integer that represents the maximum distance any city is from a space station.

flatlandSpaceStations has the following parameter(s):

- n: the number of cities
- c: an integer array that contains the indices of cities with a space station, **1**-based indexing

## Input Format

The first line consists of two space-separated integers, **n** and **m**.<br/>
The second line contains **m** space-separated integers, the indices of each city having a space-station. These values are unordered and unique.

## Constraints

- 1 <= n <= 10<sup>5</sup>
- 1 <= m <= n
- There will be at least **1** city with a space station.
- No city has more than one space station.

## Output Format

Print an integer denoting the maximum distance that an astronaut in a Flatland city would need to travel to reach the nearest space station.

## Sample Input 0

```
5 2
0 4
```

## Sample Output 0

```
2
```

## Explanation 0

This sample corresponds to following graphic:

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/hr-challenge-images/15233/1449763282-eddfbea90c-hreasy5.png)

The distance to the nearest space station for each city is listed below:

- **c[0]** has distance **0 km**, as it contains a space station.
- **c[1]** has distance **1 km** to the space station in **c[0]**.
- **c[2]** has distance **2 km** to the space stations in **c[0]** and **c[4]**.
- **c[3]** has distance **1 km** to the space station in **c[4]**.
- **c[4]** has distance **0 km**, as it contains a space station.

We then take **max(0,1,2,1,0) = 2**.

## Sample Input 1

```
6 6
0 1 2 4 3 5
```

## Sample Output 1

```
0
```

## Explanation 1

In this sample,**n = m** so every city has space station and we print **0** as our answer.

### Solution

```javascript
// Complete the flatlandSpaceStations function below.
function flatlandSpaceStations(n, c) {
  let max = 0;

  c.sort((a, b) => a - b);

  for (let i of Array.from({ length: c.length - 1 }, (value, index) => index)) {
    let value = +Math.ceil((c[i + 1] - c[i] - 1) / 2.0);
    value > max && (max = value);
  }

  c[0] - 0 > max && (max = c[0] - 0);

  n - 1 - c[c.length - 1] > max && (max = n - 1 - c[c.length - 1]);

  return max;
}
```
