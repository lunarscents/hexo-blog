The previous challenges covered [Insertion Sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insertion_sort), which is a simple and intuitive sorting algorithm with a running time of **O(n<sup>2</sup>)**. In these next few challenges, we're covering a divide-and-conquer algorithm called [Quicksort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksort) (also known as Partition Sort). This challenge is a modified version of the algorithm that only addresses partitioning. It is implemented as follows:

## Step 1: Divide

Choose some pivot element, **p**, and partition your unsorted array, **arr**, into three smaller arrays: **left**, **right**, and **equal**, where each element in **left < p**, each element in **right > p**, and each element in **equal = p**.

## Example

**arr = [5, 7, 4, 3, 8]**

In this challenge, the pivot will always be at **arr[0]**, so the pivot is **5**.

**arr** is divided into **left = {4,3}**, **equal = {5}**, and **right = {7,8}**.
Putting them all together, you get **{4,3,5,7,8}**. There is a flexible checker that allows the elements of **left** and **right** to be in any order. For example, **{3,4,5,8,7}** is valid as well.

Given **arr** and **p = arr[0]**, partition **arr** into **left**, **right**, and **equal** using the Divide instructions above. Return a 1-dimensional array containing each element in **left** first, followed by each element in **equal**, followed by each element in **right**.

## Function Description

Complete the quickSort function in the editor below.

quickSort has the following parameter(s):

- int arr[n]: **arr[0]** is the pivot element

## Returns

- int[n]: an array of integers as described above

## Input Format

The first line contains **n**, the size of **arr**.
The second line contains **n** space-separated integers **arr[i]** (the unsorted array). The first integer, **arr[0]**, is the pivot element, **p**.

## Constraints

- **1 <= n <= 1000**
- **-1000 <= arr[i] <= 1000 where 0 <= i < n**
- **All elements are distinct.**

## Sample Input

```
STDIN       Function
-----       --------
5           arr[] size n =5
4 5 3 7 2   arr =[4, 5, 3, 7, 2]
```

## Sample Output

```
3 2 4 5 7
```

## Explanation

**arr = [4,5,3,7,2,]** Pivot: **p = arr[0] = 4**.

**left = {}**; **equal = {4}**; **right = {}**

**arr[1] = 5 > p**, so it is added to **right**.

**left = {}**; **equal = {4}**; **right = {5}**

**arr[2] = 3 < p**, so it is added to **left**.

**left = {3}**; **equal = {4}**; **right = {5}**

**arr[3] = 7 > p**, so it is added to **right**.

**left = {3}**; **equal = {4}**; **right = {5,7}**

**arr[4] = 2 < p**, so it is added to **left**.

**left = {3,2}**; **equal = {4}**; **right = {5,7}**

Return the array **{32457}**.

The order of the elements to the left and right of **4** does not need to match this answer. It is only required that **3** and **2** are to the left of **4**, and **5** and **7** are to the right.

## Solution

```javascript
/*
 * Complete the 'quickSort' function below.
 *
 * The function is expected to return an INTEGER_ARRAY.
 * The function accepts INTEGER_ARRAY arr as parameter.
 */

function quickSort(arr) {
  // Write your code here
  const result = [[], [], []];

  arr.reduce((target, item, index) => {
    result[(item > arr[0]) + (item >= arr[0])].push(item);

    return target;
  }, []);

  return result.flat();
}
```
